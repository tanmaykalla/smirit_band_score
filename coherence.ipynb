    "essay=\"\"\"In recent years, the question of whether animals should be kept in zoos has become increasingly controversial. In my opinion, there is nothing cruel about animals being kept in captivity. In fact, there are a number of advantages which I will outline below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I would argue that most animals are well looked-after because there are strict regulations in place relating to animal welfare. Zoos are regularly inspected and the animals are cared for by experts and given food, shelter and medicine if they fall ill, so there is little evidence to suggest that animals are suffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second reason in favour of zoos is that many animals are being hunted to extinction in the wild and others are dying out due to loss of habitat. Successful breeding and conservation programmes can ensure the survival of endangered animals such as pandas and polar bears so that they are protected for generations to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are educational reasons for keeping animals in zoos. Children are able to see animals from all over the world up close and this helps encourage an interest in wildlife and a desire to protect animals in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I believe that keeping animals in zoos is no more cruel than keeping them at home. The only important thing is to care for them properly.\"\"\""
